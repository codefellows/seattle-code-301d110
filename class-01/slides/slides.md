# `Code of Conduct`

## Safe Learning Environment

<div>

<div>

- This is an environment where every individual is safe and respected.

<br>

- Harassment and discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.

<br>

- If you have concerns, please notify your instructor, Campus Director, and/or email us at: conduct@codefellows.com

</div>

NOTE:
Our vision and mission are very ambitious.
When you combine learning something difficult quickly with people from all backgrounds there is high potential for stress.
The way we keep things moving smoothly is by the whole school including staff and students being held accountable to this Code of Conduct.

Share a link with your class that details your school’s code of conduct. For example: https://codefellows.github.io/code-of-conduct/

# `Code of Conduct`

## Plagiarism

<div>

<div>

### Academic Dishonesty

- Make sure to give proper attribution to sources you draw from for your projects:

"`_______`" helped with "`_______`"

- Add it to your documentation as a footnote, or a README or collab.md doc in your repo

- Never copy and paste

</div>

If you feel desperate enough to cheat you need more help. We have a good staff to student ratio

Ultimately, plagiarism is cheating yourself out of the maximum learning experience.

Professionally speaking, it’s also the kind of thing that brings lawsuits onto an employers.

- 90% attendance required.
- No assignments in project week
- Instructor approval required

NOTE:
Why do we put so much emphasis on Instructor approval? Maybe you’re an amazing coder and also not very nice to people or professional. That goes against our vision and mission of making the tech industry a better place. Our reputation in the community is critical to you all finding jobs.

Remember what we talked about in the 201 orientation?

EI is the ability to identify and control your emotions and connect with the emotions of others

- Five Components
  - Self- Awareness
  - Self- Regulation
  - Motivation
  - Empathy
  - Social Skills

Key way to apply emotional intelligence is in coming to term with our implicit biases.
We begin with self-awareness and as we dig into this a bit deeper it allows us to examine our biases.

# `Bias Defined`

<div>

<div>

**Bias** is defined as prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way that is considered to be unfair.

<br>

**Bias** can be seen as the overarching definition of **stereotype** and prejudice, because it is how we associate traits (usually negative) to a specific group of people.

</div>

![bias](/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-01/slides/assets/bias.jpeg)

We have to unlearn them, and actively work against these, especially if we want to be better at the work we do to serve the greater good for all.

# `How Do We Mitigate Bias?`

<div>

**To start to combat unconscious bias, we must be vulnerable and self-reflect on our own opinions and snap judgements.** <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<div>

![bias2](/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-01/slides/assets/bias2.png)

</div>

</div>

NOTE:
How do we mitigate the bias that we all have?

**Ask** the following questions for thought, not for an answer:

1. Who is this group would you say is the most creative we all gravitate to one or two people (pause)
2. Who is the CEO in this group, and we will all gravitate to one or two of people ( pause)

That is how bias becomes dangerous.  How do we start to combat these preconceived ideas we have about people?
To start to combat the unconscious bias we must be vulnerable, able to self-reflect on our own opinions and snap judgements.

# `Explicit Bias / Conscious Bias`

- Overt negative attitudes and beliefs we have about other people or groups.
- Can be expressed through physical and verbal harrassment or through more subtle means such as excluding, barring, or disempowering.

</div>

![questionmark](/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-01/slides/assets/bias3.jpeg)

NOTE:
Let’s talk first about Explicit Bias or Conscious Bias

These are the obvious acts of discrimination, it is clear that the person is deliberately trying to hurt someone physically or emotionally.

Everything we do is to prepare you for the tech industry. This brief conversation is a part of that. We will dive in deeper during the Diversity and Inclusion talk later in your course.

<!-- SLIDE 19 -->
<!-- .element class="split-screen-with-title" -->

# `Implicit Bias`

<div>

<div>

These types of biases are not always conscious but rather the stories we've made up about people before we know who they really are.

<br>

**Who is missing from your circle?** <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

</div>

![broken gear](/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-01/slides/assets/gear.png)

</div>

NOTE:
This is the second type of bias which are important to be aware of as we interact with people. For the most part it is not always conscious but can provide areas of personal and professional growth as we deal with our ideas of other people.

We have a **bias** when, rather than being neutral, we have a preference for (or aversion to) a person or group of people.

The term **“implicit bias”** describes when we have attitudes towards people or associate stereotypes with them without our conscious knowledge.

9 types of implicit bias highlighted in the article https://www.socialtalent.com/blog/recruitment/9-types-of-bias.

Next few slides will highlight three that happen when working in groups/teams as well as in the workplace.

---

<!-- SLIDE 21 -->
<!-- .element class="split-screen-with-title" -->

# `Conformity: Groupthink`

<div>

<div>

- **In-group/out-group dynamics** - you unfairly favor those who belong to your group

<br>

- **Groupthink** - you let the social dynamics of a group situation override the best outcomes

</div>

![groupthink](/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-01/slides/assets/groupthink.png)

</div>

NOTE:
It is important to make sure you are not just going with the group because it is easier.

A strong team's members need to be able to have independent thought and speak up when they have ideas.
This is also preparation for the workplace.

In the first few weeks of class you may recognize people who you worked well with in 201.  This is when work groups may form during lab time, or who you are talking to on slack.

This can positively or negatively affect how you continue on in the class.  When one or two people begin to complain then groupthink has everyone connected complaining.

If that is the case: Find another group. Overcoming Groupthink requires psychological safety in the group.

---

<!-- SLIDE 22 -->
<!-- .element class="split-screen-with-title" -->

# `Confirmation Bias`

<div>

<div>

- Confirmation bias is the tendency of people to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses.

<br>

- People display this bias when they gather or recall information selectively, or when they interpret in a biased way.

</div>

![confirmation bias](/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-01/slides/assets/confirmationbias.png)

</div>

NOTE:
**For Example:**

If you were to search “Are cats better than dogs?” in Google, all you will get are sites listing the reasons why cats are better.

However, if you were to search “Are dogs better than cats?” google will only provide you with sites that believe dogs are better than cats.

This shows that phrasing questions in a one-sided way (i.e. affirmative manner) will assist you in obtaining evidence consistent with your hypothesis.

https://www.simplypsychology.org/confirmation-bias.html

So you are paired with someone from a different ethnic group or sex.  If you focus on the difference rather than the commonality you may be resting on a bias, confirming something you thought about a different group.

---

<!-- SLIDE 23 -->
<!-- .element class="split-screen-with-title" -->

# `Attribution Bias`

<div>

<div>

The tendency to have a different rationale for your own behavior vs. that of others

<br>

- Your errors are due to motives and circumstances.
- Another person making the same error is attributed to their character or personality.

</div>

![scales](/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-01/slides/assets/scales.png)

</div>

NOTE:
If we do something well we tend to think it’s down to our own merit and personality. When we do something badly we tend to believe that our failing is due to external factors, like other people that adversely affected us and prevented us from doing our best.

When it comes to other people, we tend to think the opposite. If someone else has done something well, we consider them lucky, and if they’ve done something badly, we tend to think it’s due to their personality or bad behaviour.

Working on a team and your task is work on code A, your partner will do the B part of the code.  You make an error and say I was up all night and made the error because I was sleepy.  Your partner makes an error and you say something like “get your head in the game”.  They could have been just as tired but you view their actions as them not taking it seriously.

# `What Are Microaggressions?`

<div>

<div>

The everyday verbal, nonverbal, environmental slights, snubs, or insults - whether intentional or unintentional - which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.

<br>

## Result is Exclusion

</div>

![](/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-01/slides/assets/boom.png)

</div>

NOTE:

**Image Credit:** Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation, 2010

According to Dr. Derald Wing Sue,
> “microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership”
>> (Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation, 2010).

Implicit biases that are “said out loud”.

**How do we treat people with different exposure levels to technology?**

Example: You are assigned to a team of 3 and one of your teammates is not at your level because they didn’t have your previous exposure to tech. You are impatient because they are just not getting it, while it all makes sense to you, so you begin to make comments like “they are dragging us down and we won’t pass at this rate”, or you feel like you need to take charge, so you overwrite their code, or insist they work on menial tasks, effectively boxing them out.

This can come up in team and group projects, can come up in the workplace, and the results is exclusion of other people.

# `What Can I Do?`

1. Increase contact with people who are different from you.
2. Notice positive examples.
3. Be specific in your intent.
4. Change the way you do things.
5. Heighten your awareness.
6. Take care of yourself.

NOTE:
Fortunately, there are steps you can take to unlearn implicit biases. But be patient because, as with most behavioral change, it’s going to take time.

**Here are some tips to help you start breaking implicit bias patterns**: https://www.rw-3.com/blog/6-ways-to-break-your-implicit-bias-patterns

None of these approaches alone will help us overcome our implicit bias.

And even collectively, they will only work if we accept that we have implicit biases and commit to diligent self-awareness.

If someone gives feedback about sensing bias, listen to them!

We must see ourselves clearly before we can begin to see others clearly.

**COPY PASTE the following into the class Slack channel:**

How can we overcome our implicit biases? Have students pick one to discuss?

- Increase contact with people who are different from you.
  - That interaction will have much greater effect if you work to form genuine friendships with those people, rather than rely on casual or infrequent contact.
- Notice positive examples.
  - One way to take advantage of this is to focus your attention on positive characteristics and actions of people who are outside your in-group.
  - The idea is to create new patterns and generalizations that are positive.
- Be specific in your intent.
  - Regardless of whether you are aware of holding specific stereotypes yourself, you can defeat negative bias by countering it intentionally.
- Change the way you do things.
  - Often, we’re stuck in negative patterns without realizing it.
- Heighten your awareness.
  - Once you become aware of something, you can’t be unaware ever again.
  - Make an effort to notice all the ways in which your perceptions are subliminally shaped.
- Take care of yourself.
  - Implicit bias is more likely to surface when we are mentally or physically exhausted or highly stressed.
  - That’s because when we’re tired or stressed, we’re less effective at processing new information and rely more on unconscious patterns.
